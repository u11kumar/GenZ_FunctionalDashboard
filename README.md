# 📊 Career Aspirations of Gen Z: Data Analysis Project

## 🎓 Project Overview
This project was created during my internship at **KultureHire** to explore the career aspirations, values, and preferences of Generation Z. Using a comprehensive dataset, I analyzed various business questions and built **3 Functional Dashboards** to visualize key insights into Gen Z's career-related choices.

The main focus was to answer questions about:
- Learning aspirations
- Managerial preferences
- Mission alignment in the workplace

These insights are critical for businesses and HR managers aiming to attract, retain, and engage the next generation of talent.
